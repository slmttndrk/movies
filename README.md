# Movie Review App - A Full Stack App with React, Java, Spring Boot and MongoDB

In this full stack development project:

> Created an application using MongoDb for the database, Java and Spring Boot for the backend, and React for the frontend.

> Developed a movie review application that will feature a separation of concerns between the client code and the server code. 

> Implemented loosely coupled architecture which can evolve in parallel and independently from one another.

Many thanks to "freeCodeCamp.org" for helping me complete this application. The app created following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PdEmeopJVQ
